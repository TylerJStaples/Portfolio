                    Born in 2000, it became apparent very early on that Tyler was in fact a genius. He began walking
                    not even the day after his birth, talking before his first meal, and even created a simple
                    combustion engine out of the toys he was given to play with.

                <h2><br>Teeange Years</h2>
                <p>
                    By 16, having exerted all his brilliance in a medical phenominon known as "dumbassery", Tyler 
                    learned what it meant to live a normal life. One that meant errands, a job, time stuck in 
                    traffic, and little more than the sweet release of a cup of coffee in the early hours of the day.
                    He is a creature of habit. He takes the same route to work every day, revs his engine at the 
                    same stoplight, squeals his tires on the same turns, plays the same music, accelerates too 
                    quickly, and gets stuck going 5mph under the speed limit by the same old geezer every morning. 
                    He is nothing if not simultaneously a multitude of the energy which only comes from rabbits 
                    in their mating season, and the other kind of energy, which is similar to the mindset 
                    that is common in plush rocking chairs.
